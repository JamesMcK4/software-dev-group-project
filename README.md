# Frontend

## Prerequisites

- Please make sure that your device has installed npm, node.js, and is compatible with React.
- In order to start the application, please start the server in the backend prior to using the 'npm start' command in the terminal in order to start the front end React application.

## Installation

- Please ensure that you have a version of node.js installed on your device (if not, download can be found here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Please ensure that you have npm package manager installed (https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- Please ensure that you are in the correct directory in order to start the React application using the 'npm start' command in the terminal(in this case, it is src/main/client). 

## Running the Frontend

- Once you have npm successfully installed, as well as node.js, please move to the correct directory (src/main/client) using the cd command, and run 'npm start' in your terminal window.  This should start the front end service.
- The front end uses port 3000, so please make sure it is not used by another application.
- Before log-in, you need to register first. Or you can use the following credentials to log in:

> emailId : "testuser@gmail.com",
>
> password: "NewPassword!8@2"

# Backend

## Prerequisites

- Please make sure you have Maven installed on your device, and that it is compatible with SpringBoot frameworks.
- If Maven is not installed on your device, you can find the download and install information here: https://maven.apache.org/ (see hyperlinks on left side of page).
- Please make sure you have access to the Dalhousie VPN in order to run the server and database together.

## Installation

- Please see above for instructions on how to install Maven if it is not installed on your device.
- Please make sure you have access to the Dalhousie network, as it is required to run the server and database.

## Running the Backend

- Once you are sure that you have all the prerequistites installed for the backend, please build and run the server by using your IDE run processes, type mvn spring-boot:run in the terminal window or run the JAR file in target.
- Please make sure port 9001 is not used by another application.

## Dependancies

- A pom.xml file has been added to the project for dependancies.  Feel free to read through if any questions/concerns about dependancies arise.
